The project aims to strengthen measures to protect animal health in response to recent outbreaks of avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). It also helps small farmers deal with the implications and challenges relating to China's compliance with OIE standards in animal health, production, and disease control.   This project involves technical assistance to establish extension systems and services and to undertake pilot programs to help farmers better prevent animal disease, including diseases transmissible to humans. Ultimately, the project aims to influence policy-makers, to demonstrate the results of policy implementation, and, more importantly, to create a sustainable system for the effective delivery of animal health services through the training of trainers, farmers, and extension workers.",Closed,2003-10-01T00:00:00,2011-03-31T00:00:00,"[""China 100.00%""]",Alinea International Ltd ,"[""Infectious disease control 30.00%"", ""Livestock 60.00%"", ""Environmental policy and administrative management 10.00%""]",17950935.08,,,"Results as of the end of the project (March 2011) include: By working with the Government of China at all levels of policy development, program implementation and grassroots training, the project made important contributions to the prevention and control of potential global pandemics.

Their strategy aims to increase self-reliance in the region and is comprised of three components: social development; women's development; and policy dialogue and partnership.

This improvement does not match the average of 19 days reported in 2009. The reduced efficiency over the past two years is attributed to staff turnover following the appointment of a new Ombudsman and the recent implementation of a new pilot system for addressing complaints designed to improve the effectiveness of the complaints process once it is fully implemented. This increased efficiency helps to ensure that potential human rights violations are addressed in a timely manner, offering improved chances for successful resolution.   Between 2009 and 2010, the National Institute of Statistics produced 65 statistical products, including ongoing data on gross domestic product (GDP) and external trade, surveys on tourism and time use, and statistics on public security and indigenous populations. These national statistics help to inform results-based policy development and decision-making.   During 2011, the Auditor General's Office implemented 77% of its 2011 Annual Plan activities (down from 85% in 2010). The Auditor General's Office faced leadership challenges in 2011, with turnover of staff in key positions.   Over 2010 and 2011, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (formerly the National Electoral Court) digitized a total of 19,200,000 civil registry records while completing quality control on 90% of these records (the remaining 10% to be completed in 2012). This has resulted in enhanced security for citizens and downstream efficiencies for service delivery. Also in 2011, voter registration increased to 5.2 million citizens, up from 5.1 million and 3.7 million in 2010 and 2006 respectively.

To date a total of 21 changes in policies, laws, regulations, and practices can be attributed to the project’s efforts to engage civil society and local government.   In all three provinces, as a result of the project, over 16,000 newspaper articles have been published, over 190 talk shows and documentary films have been produced and aired, and 298 radio talk shows have been broadcast, all related to environmental and natural resource governance issues. At least two dozen journalists received training or participated in learning trips, providing them with skills to improve factual reporting on natural resources management issues. In North Sulawesi, over 250,000 people routinely read the articles produced and 1.1 million people have been reached through television shows. Readers in South Sulawesi are estimated at around 750,000.

Approximately 927 hectares of mangroves have been rehabilitated, 102 hectares funded directly through this project and 825 using expertise provided through the project. Villages have adopted regulations to manage local access to and control over mangrove resources. Awareness about the importance of mangroves has increased and collective action to conserve them is taking place, not only in the eight villages that participated in the project, but also in neighbouring villages, which are voluntarily replicating what they have observed. District governments have publicly acknowledged the key role of mangroves in sustaining livelihoods and coastal development and have declared a ban on mangrove clearance. Some of the four mangrove working groups established through the project have secured government funding for rehabilitating mangrove areas. These working groups have established mangrove information centres, completed ecological surveys, and developed and implemented environmental education curricula.

The fund is administered by the Canadian embassy in the Philippines. (ii) Electoral assistance to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and adjoining areas in the May 2007 local elections. This component was managed by the Asia Foundation. The Foundation undertook targeted activities to support the May 2007 local elections, in order to strengthen the credibility and legitimacy of the process and results.

In addition, 100 representatives from non-governmental organizations, decentralized government bodies, and traditional and religious authorities strengthened their capacities and skills in the managing and monitoring of information, intervention, and case management initiatives. 15 representatives from civil-society organizations were involved in developing training and educational materials for training community workers.   Moreover, the victim management units within four ministries are better equipped to train their intervention workers and over 100 community workers were trained to raise awareness of domestic violence in four regions of Burkina Faso. An intervention model was developed and tested in several regions. Case monitoring is increasing and enables greater cooperation among organizations.

Project activities ended in September 2012, but the project remains in operational status as an evaluation is being undertaken.",Closed,2007-05-31T00:00:00,2012-09-28T00:00:00,,AMREF - African Medical and Research Foundation ,"[""Health policy and administrative management 20.00%"", ""Basic health care 20.00%"", ""Health education 30.00%"", ""Health personnel development 20.00%"", ""STD control including HIV/AIDS 10.00%""]",15124105.12,,,"Results achieved as of the end of the project (September 2012): AMREF grew from five country offices and training and consultancy programs in 17 countries to seven country offices (two being regional hubs) with programs in 35 countries. AMREF’s programming grew from 105 projects to 160 and almost doubled financially, with the majority of projects being in the area of maternal, newborn, and child health. This growth is a result of AMREF’s increased ability to manage large projects and provide support to its country offices and also increased donor confidence in AMREF’s organizational systems and skills. AMREF started to measure population coverage in 2010. Since 2010, AMREF’s reach has grown from approximately 5 million people (40% women) to over 21.5 million people (57% women) in approximately 200 underserved communities in 42 countries.   Between 2010 and 2012, AMREF trained approximately 500,000 health workers (60% women). AMREF helped to improve the skills of Africa’s health workforce by developing a Masters degree program in Public Health, an e-learning diploma program in Community Health (115 health workers from 15 countries have graduated), a Community Health Nursing diploma upgrade program (over 8,000 nurses have upgraded from a certificate to a diploma), and Bachelor of Science programs in Community Health and in Nursing Education. In 2010, AMREF developed a curriculum on strengthening health system governance, leadership, and management and trained 76 trainers from 17 African countries to provide this training in their respective countries.   AMREF health models and approaches have been adopted by African Ministries of Health and AMREF is called upon to attend high-level World Health Organization meetings, to help Ministries of Health develop national policy, and to contribute to international health policy development.   AMREF won several awards: the World Federation of Public Health Associations 2012 Award for outstanding achievements and contributions to public health; AMREF was named among the top 100 NGOs in the world by the Global Journal, concerned with international governance; and AMREF’s Flying Doctors were awarded the Air Ambulance Provider of the Year award.   With Canada’s support, AMREF developed a Business Plan for 2011-2014 that focuses on maternal, newborn, and child health and other health system priorities. The new Business Plan includes the development of business models and fundraising strategies that will help AMREF generate income to cover its own operating costs, which will boost AMREF's financial sustainability and reduce its dependence on donor agencies.   Overall, this project has helped AMREF better respond to and prevent health systems challenges. The project has also helped AMREF become more visible and influential as a contributor to health policy at the national, regional, and global levels.","Core support to NGOs, other private bodies, PPPs and research institutes","Bilateral, core contributions to NGOs and other private bodies / PPPs",Aid grant excluding debt reorganisation,,Global Affairs Canada,WGM Africa,Pre-APP,"[""Gender equality"", ""Environmental sustainability (cross-cutting)"", ""Participatory development and good governance"", ""Trade development"", ""Biodiversity"", ""Climate change mitigation"", ""Climate Change Adaptation"", ""Urban issues"", ""Desertification"", ""Children's issues"", ""Youth Issues"", ""Indigenous Issues"", ""Disability"", ""ICT as a tool for development""]","[""South of Sahara, regional""]",,"[""500000.00"", ""2600000.00"", ""3100000.00"", ""3100000.00"", ""3100000.00"", ""3100000.00""]","[""-25.96553 32.58322"", ""-18.91368 47.53613"", ""-6.17221 35.73947"", ""-1.28333 36.81667"", ""-1.94995 30.05885"", ""11.58901 43.14503"", ""-8.83682 13.23432"", ""0.31628 32.58219"", ""-4.61667 55.45"", ""12.10672 15.0444"", ""13.51366 2.1098"", ""12.65 -8"", ""-22.55941 17.08323"", ""15.33805 38.93184"", ""9.02497 38.74689"", ""4.85165 31.58247"", ""15.55177 32.53241"", ""-3.3822 29.3644"", ""2.03711 45.34375"", ""-17.82772 31.05337"", ""-15.40669 28.28713"", ""-11.70216 43.25506"", ""-13.96692 33.78725"", ""-29.31667 27.48333"", ""-24.65451 25.90859"", ""-20.16194 57.49889"", ""-26.31667 31.13333"", ""-25.74486 28.18783""]","[""2007000051""]","[""AMREF - African Medical and Research Foundation ""]",,,"[""15124105.12"", ""750000.00"", ""579712.50"", ""750000.00"", ""650000.00"", ""-679575.00"", ""679575.00"", ""679575.00"", ""750000.00"", ""750000.00"", ""750000.00"", ""-752964.18"", ""721770.00"", ""752964.18"", ""651090.30"", ""760743.52"", ""683936.00"", ""682261.00"", ""750000.00"", ""750000.00"", ""750000.00"", ""424013.21"", ""750000.00"", ""819864.00"", ""70109.96"", ""-394328.00"", ""-70109.96"", ""394328.00"", ""394671.30"", ""452364.00"", ""749999.17""]"

This support was delivered through various types of interactive capacity building programs that rated very high in client satisfaction surveys. These included networking programs, seminars, mentorships and special programs such as a procurement program focused on women; (3) notwithstanding these successes, some of the key objectives were not met.

The loan component was discontinued in early 2013; (4)  Enablis was not able to secure the full original commitments from its private sector partners and sponsors. The resulting fiscal squeeze contributed to higher operational and program costs, which in turn hindered the development of a sustainable plan that would have seen operations continue beyond the end of the agreement with Global Affairs Canada.

Mixed-gender Community Peace Councils have been established and have led to extended conflict-free periods as a result of the Councils’ intensive role in consultation and issue resolution, and engagement of the communities in more productive farm and off-farm activities. (2) Food security: As a result of training provided to improve farming techniques and distribution of farming inputs, the acreage under cultivation and the production of groundnuts, grains, fish, and vegetables has increased. In targeted communities in both Jonglei State and Western Bahr El Ghazal, the hunger gap was reduced on average from 120 to 30 and 45 days per year respectively. With more food available in households, the need for rationing has decreased.

In total, 21 Canadian electoral observers were deployed during these missions. During the course of this project, electoral observation missions have become more rigorous and evidence-based, due to the incorporation of gender perspective and the ongoing development of methodologies to observe the use of electoral technology, media, and systems of electoral and political financing. The development of some of the methodologies and tools implemented (such as the manual for incorporating a Gender Perspective into OAS Electoral Observation Missions and the manual on Observing Political-Electoral Financing Systems) was initiated in a previous phase of the project Electoral Assistance for the Americas (A034062002). The OAS has institutionalised these methodologies, which are now standard practice in electoral observation missions. As a result, these allow the OAS to expand its focus of observation and electoral observation mission reports reflect a more comprehensive analysis of the electoral process.   Furthermore, the application of these specialised methodologies allowed the OAS to issue more specific and targeted recommendations in its electoral observation mission’s final reports, which have exerted significant impact on electoral systems in the region. For example, the decision of the National Electoral Council of Ecuador in June 2013 to implement a quality electoral management system and pursue certification under the new ISO electoral standard was motivated in part by the recommendations of the 2013 OAS electoral observation mission report, which aimed to strengthen institutional planning and bolster the capacity of electoral staff.

The project has brought up to date the Water and Sanitation sector public policy on Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and established DRM practices in urban utilities. Some policy recommendations and tools have been designed to support the Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation, as well as the national regulatory entity, the National Superintendence of Sanita tion Services (SUNASS), for them to continue improving on results in the area of disaster risk management. In this context, the WSP has produced different publications and documents that have been very useful for promoting knowledge and building a culture of disaster risk management (e.g. a study “Economic Impact of the Earthquake occurred in Ica in August, 2007 within the Affected Areas”, a methodological guide for the integration of risk management in the entities providing water and sanitation services).   Thanks to the WSP efforts and intervention, a new law that creates the National System of Disaster Risk Management has been passed, which is ruled by the Prime Minister Office, a new partner of the World Bank WSP in the field of Risk Disaster Prevention and Management.  This new law will be applied even since the pre-feasibility studies for infrastructure works and incorporates a culture of risk prevention in the country.   Peru is making the Water and Sanitation Sector a greater priority as part of its efforts to reduce vulnerability to future natural disasters.  For the first time, Peru’s national budget in 2012 allocated resources specifically to water and sanitation as part of these efforts and the sector was added as part of a “contingency matrix” that will guide a credit line with the World Bank in the event of a natural disaster.   Over the last year, the project has built the capacity of the national water authority (SEDAPAL) and the municipal water utility company in the city of Ica (EMAPICA) to assess the physical risks and financial costs to the water and sanitation systems that may be caused by another earthquake or other natural disaster. The project also organized a national workshop on natural disaster prevention and risk management, training  representatives from 40 local water utilities.     The City of Chincha has developed a cadastral map that covers 50% of its territory through the project. This work formed the basis for an application to the national government in Lima for funding to complete the land register and build capacity for local Peruvians to continue doing this kind of work.   The project has featured in two international conferences on water and sanitation and disaster risk reduction (the Program Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management in Water and Sanitation Conference, from June 7 – 9, 2011 in Oaxaca, Mexico and the World Water Week: Responding to Global Changes – Water in an Urbanising World, from August 21 – 27, 2011 in Stockholm, Sweden).

In particular, the communities were involved in improving their environment by constructing improved latrines and reducing stagnant water around their houses. They were also involved in revenue-generating activities such as chicken production and sewing; and organized regular forums to discuss the health of their communities.   The Ministry of Health’s annual institutional evaluations of its training centres ranked the Massinga Centre among the top two, out of 14, for four years in a row, maintaining the centre’s reputation as a model for Mozambique. It plays a lead role in helping the Ministry of Health develop an innovative national teacher training program, including a distance-learning curriculum based on the centre’s expertise and its community-based methodology. The Massinga Centre developed both the curriculum for the preventive medicine technicians and the curriculum for the updating of the technicians who were trained when the course was shorter. The Ministry also asked the Massinga Centre to pilot its methodology and disseminate it among training centres across the country. This has started with the distribution of teaching modules and visits to 13 out of 14 training centres.

More than 1,500 stakeholders were trained and engaged with ASEAN at local, regional and international levels; and created and disseminated more than 30 critical advocacy documents on the rights of women and girls; and (5) the programme also provided training to ASEAN Secretariat staff on women’s and girls’ human rights issues to enable them to support the implementation of the AICHR and ACWC workplans.",Contributions to specific-purpose programmes and funds managed by implementing partners,Bilateral,Aid grant excluding debt reorganisation,,Global Affairs Canada,OGM Indo-Pacific,Pre-APP,"[""Gender equality"", ""Environmental sustainability (cross-cutting)"", ""Participatory development and good governance"", ""Trade development"", ""Biodiversity"", ""Climate change mitigation"", ""Climate Change Adaptation"", ""Urban issues"", ""Desertification"", ""Children's issues"", ""Youth Issues"", ""Indigenous Issues"", ""Disability"", ""ICT as a tool for development""]","[""Far East Asia, regional""]",,"[""1500000.00"", ""1500000.00""]","[""21.0245 105.84117"", ""13.75398 100.50144"", ""-6.21462 106.84513"", ""-8.55861 125.57361"", ""17.96667 102.6"", ""14.6042 120.9822"", ""3.1412 101.68653"", ""11.56245 104.91601"", ""19.745 96.12972""]","[""2010200128""]","[""UN Women ""]",,,"[""2948269.81"", ""1500000.00"", ""1450000.00"", ""-1730.19""]"

Infant mortality indicators exceeded the MDG targets.

Canada provided ongoing support for holding PRODESS meetings at all levels in order to improve the management and governance of the health system. A good example of how the system has been strengthened is the system’s resistance in the face of two major crises: the crisis in the North and a population influx to the South. While the health system was completely destroyed in northern Mali, the South was able to deal with the population influx and to continue to provide essential services.

The project is designed to use the findings of its applied research to influence national and regional policy affecting the African rice industry to ensure that agricultural policy considers the needs of all rice agricultural stakeholders, especially local farmers.   Rice is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa. Both urban and rural populations have come to depend on it as a food staple that is easy to prepare, store and provides a high source of calories, making it an essential complement to good nutrition. In 2010, Africans consumed an estimated 26 million tons of rice, with an average per capita consumption rate of 24 kg per year. The formal African rice industry with its limited means for production is not able to meet this consumer demand with a yearly production of 16 million tons of rice. As a result, 40% of African rice consumers rely on global imports to satisfy their dietary needs.

The CMAA’s capacity for mine action planning and monitoring and ensuring greater transparency and cost-efficiency in making land available to poor women and men living in rural areas was significantly improved. The CMAA promoted the efficient use of resources by demining operators by undertaking a competitive bidding process to award mines clearance contracts and by ensuring that baseline surveys were undertaken to allocate mine clearance assets and resources more efficiently and coherently.The CMAA also issued new control procedures to strengthen its performance management systems and increase its operational efficiency and effectiveness.

Nigeria is one of three countries in the world where children can still contract polio. Children under the age of five are the most at risk for polio infections and the risk is highest in northern Nigeria. It is estimated that 600,000 Nigerian children under five have never received a single dose of the polio vaccine. This project contributes to increasing the percentage of children under five who receive a full complement of vaccinations, including the polio vaccine, from 23% to 85% by 2015.   This project supports the polio immunization activities of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in Nigeria. Polio vaccination campaigns occur regularly throughout Nigeria both at the national level and at the state level, in areas where there is a higher rate of polio infections. The polio vaccination campaigns are also used as a platform for delivering other essential health services, such as routine vaccinations against common preventable diseases and health education. In addition, the project works with political, traditional, and religious leaders in Nigeria to build momentum toward greater community acceptance of polio immunization.   The WHO is responsible for technical assistance, training, post-immunization campaign assessment surveys, data analysis, and report writing. The WHO also coordinates research, provides technical and operational support to the Federal and State Ministries of Health, and coordinates the training and deployment of human resources.",Closed,2012-12-24T00:00:00,2015-03-30T00:00:00,"[""Nigeria 100.00%""]",WHO - World Health Organization ,"[""Infectious disease control 100.00%""]",18000000.00,,"The expected intermediate results for this project include: (1) increased detection of polio cases and response to common communicable diseases; (2) increased and sustained immunity of target groups against wild polio transmission in all districts of the twelve highest risk states; and (3) increased protection of Nigerians with routine immunization against common preventable diseases, including polio.

Given that rates of tuberculosis among miners are 20 to 30 times that of the average population (as of 2010), and given that miners are often migrant labourers, understanding the linkages between tuberculosis and the mining sector is key to stemming the spread of the disease overall. The project undertakes an analysis of the burden of tuberculosis in mine-workers' communities of origin, based on in-country data collection. This high-level, policy relevant analysis is key to making informed programming decisions and to mobilizing global resources. The analysis also outlines public-private partnership interventions which may be taken on by global health actors to address the challenge of tuberculosis in mining communities in a comprehensive fashion.

While the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) plays the lead role in helping to ensure the protection of refugees and internally displaced populations, the World Food Programme (WFP) also contributes to address situations of critical food insecurity. Given the needs of other WFP operations, donors often overlook refugee programs. As a result, in many operations, rations for refugees are often below minimum standards. UNHCR and WFP have thus joined efforts to raise awareness on programming gaps affecting refugees, and to address acute malnutrition in humanitarian contexts.

As a result, a consortium of agencies came together in 1996 to establish the Emergency Nutrition Network (ENN) to synthesize the multiple experiences of humanitarian agencies conducting food and nutrition interventions. The mission of the organization is to accelerate the process of learning to ensure that people of humanitarian concern receive the most effective help in nutrition and food aid based upon prevailing field-based, best practice and knowledge.  With a small skeleton staff and relatively low operating costs, since 1997, ENN has become a key actor for maintaining a network of experts in nutrition and food aid, facilitating international inter-agency meetings on infant feeding and developing evidence-based operational guidelines and training modules on the effective delivery of food aid and nutrition in emergencies.  With CIDA support, ENN Phase V continues the publication of Field Exchange, its trainings in ENN`s developed of infant feeding in emergencies (IFE) manual, and advance research and policy work on nutrition and food aid in emergencies.",Closed,2007-08-01T00:00:00,2010-01-29T00:00:00,,Emergency Nutrition Network ,"[""Material relief assistance and services 100.00%""]",105000.01,,,,Project-type interventions,Bilateral,Aid grant excluding debt reorganisation,,Global Affairs Canada,International Assistance Partnerships an,Pre-APP,"[""Gender equality"", ""Environmental sustainability (cross-cutting)"", ""Participatory development and good governance"", ""Trade development"", ""Biodiversity"", ""Climate change mitigation"", ""Climate Change Adaptation"", ""Desertification"", ""Urban issues"", ""Children's issues"", ""Youth Issues"", ""Disability"", ""Indigenous Issues"", ""ICT as a tool for development""]","[""Asia, regional"", ""Europe, regional"", ""Africa, regional"", ""America, regional""]",,"[""35000.00"", ""35000.00"", ""35000.00"", ""0.00""]",,"[""2007000676""]","[""Emergency Nutrition Network ""]",,,"[""105000.01"", ""35000.00"", ""35000.00"", ""35000.00""]"

Given that WFP is entirely voluntarily funded, it depends on donors in order to respond to the immediate food aid needs of affected populations during humanitarian crises or natural disasters. The IRA therefore plays a critical role in filling in funding gaps, to ensure that the basic food aid needs of the most vulnerable populations are met in a timely manner.   Historically, Canada has provided considerable support to the IRA, which is consistent with our desire to strengthen humanitarian agencies' rapid response capacity.

Two-thirds of the grant facility is to be used to respond to needs in rapid-onset crises, with one third responding to ""forgotten emergencies"". The overall objective of CIDA's grant program to the CERF is to increase the timeliness and equity of humanitarian funding. With the new grant facility, it is expected that humanitarian actors do not have to wait for donors to make pledges in order to commence their humanitarian activities. Also, they are able to respond to critical humanitarian needs in so-called ""forgotten emergencies"" which do not always receive funding in the same proportion as high-profile crises. Recommendations for the use of the CERF comes from UN Humanitarian Coordinators in the field or individual humanitarian agencies. All applications for CERF funding are approved by the UN Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator.

A system-wide review of humanitarian response has identified the provision of logistics in emergency response situations as an area requiring further improvement. As such, Canada is providing support to the World Food Programme (WFP) as the Global Cluster lead to strengthen the capacity of all stakeholders to deliver a more effective and predictable logistics response during emergencies.   Logistics officers from the various UN agencies, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, International Red Cross and Red Crescent societies need to work even closer together to be more operationally cohesive in the theatre of an emergency. There are two elements to this - contingency planning (including stockpiling) and emergency response. The global logistics cluster provides surge capacity in the form of Logistics Response Teams (LRTs) for rapid assessment of logistics needs. In 2007, it is a top priority to complete the formation and training of these teams to ensure sufficient expertise and surge capacity.   The 2007 Global Logistics Cluster work plan aims to: i) initiate inter-agency/organizational logistics planning to compliment the contingency planning process; ii) work in support of other clusters on stockpiling strategies for relief items; iii) advocate for increased logistics staffing and stockpiled logistics support equipment for other clusters; iv) support the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in maintaining the stockpile register; v) promote improved and, where necessary, standardized terminology and monitoring/tracking systems; vi) ensure that surge capacity in the form of fully trained logistics officers are available when needed; vii) provide technical support and normative guidance to members and field logistics clusters, including on cross cutting issues; and viii) facilitate joint training programmes.",Closed,2007-04-01T00:00:00,2010-06-30T00:00:00,,WFP - World Food Programme ,"[""Material relief assistance and services 100.00%""]",500000.00,,,,Contributions to specific-purpose programmes and funds managed by implementing partners,Bilateral,Aid grant excluding debt reorganisation,,Global Affairs Canada,International Assistance Partnerships an,Pre-APP,"[""Gender equality"", ""Environmental sustainability (cross-cutting)"", ""Participatory development and good governance"", ""Trade development"", ""Biodiversity"", ""Climate change mitigation"", ""Climate Change Adaptation"", ""Urban issues"", ""Desertification"", ""Children's issues"", ""Youth Issues"", ""Indigenous Issues"", ""Disability"", ""ICT as a tool for development""]","[""Africa, regional"", ""America, regional"", ""Asia, regional"", ""Europe, regional""]",,"[""500000.00""]","[{""geoName"": ""6255147"", ""SRSName"": ""http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326""}, {""geoName"": ""6255148"", ""SRSName"": ""http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326""}, {""geoName"": ""6255150"", ""SRSName"": ""http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326""}]","[""2007000683""]","[""WFP - World Food Programme ""]",,,"[""500000.00"", ""500000.00""]"

For the period 2008-2010, the ADF focused on three core operational priorities: (i) infrastructure development, (ii) governance, and (iii) regional integration. A framework for supporting fragile states complements this focus. The Fund also seeks to maximize synergies with the Bank’s private sector work. These areas together constitute the primary instruments for the Fund’s support of more inclusive growth, agriculture and rural development, and social and human development. They also are the areas where the Fund seeks to mainstream attention to the critical cross-cutting objectives with respect to gender, environment and climate change.",Closed,2007-11-01T00:00:00,2010-05-17T00:00:00,,African Development Bank Group ,"[""Higher education 7.00%"", ""Water supply - large systems 10.00%"", ""Sanitation - large systems 10.00%"", ""Public sector policy and administrative management 20.00%"", ""Road transport 20.00%"", ""Electric power transmission and  distribution 20.00%"", ""Agricultural development 13.00%""]",302400000.00,,,"Results achieved as of the end of the project (2008 to 2010) include:   Microfinance and Social Sector: created 239 000 jobs and helped over 52 000 businesses owned or operated by women.
